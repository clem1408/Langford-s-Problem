# Langford-s-Problem
Here are all the implementations I have developed to solve Langford's Problem.

Langfordv1: Sequential, unoptimized solution. <br>
Langfordv2: Sequential, optimized solution. <br>
Langfordv3: Sequential with task pre-initialize tasks. <br>
Langfordv4: Langfordv3 with openmp (not optimized). <br>
Langfordv6: Langfordv3 with mpi. <br>
Langfordv7: A rust version base on buffers for each step and inline fixed size for loop to go faster best : L(2,16)= 29s

Credits: Thanks to all collaborators of the project, as we discussed together about ways to implement those solutions to improve them, and special thanks to Mr. Jaillet, one of my teachers at Universit√© de Reims Champagne-Ardenne.
