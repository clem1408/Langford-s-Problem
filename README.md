# Langford-s-Problem
Here are all the implementations I have developed to solve Langford's Problem.

Langfordv1: Sequential, unoptimized solution. <br>
Langfordv2: Sequential, optimized solution.

Credits: Thanks to all collaborators of the project, as we discussed together about ways to implement those solutions to improve them, and special thanks to Mr. Jaillet, one of my teachers at Universit√© de Reims Champagne-Ardenne.
